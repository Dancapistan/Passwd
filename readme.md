Passwd, a human-friendly password generator
===========================================

Using a list of the 5,000 most common English words, filtered to be PG and easy to type, this script returns a random selection of words to use as a secure but easy-to-remember password.

There are currently over English 5,000 words in the list. This means each word has `log2(5260) = 12.36` bits of entropy. Therefore, a 4-word password would have 49 bits of entropy, and a 5-word password would have almost 62 bits.

Usage
-----

At the prompt, type ./passwd.rb and, optionally, the number of words you want (defaults to 4):

    $ ./passwd.rb 7
    ugly pets night claws thrill legend bee
    
    $ ./passwd.rb 3
    traded scars audio
